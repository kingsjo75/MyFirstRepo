Throughout this course, I have learned the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, including how to create repositories, make commits, 
work with branches, and collaborate through pull requests. I now understand how version control helps track changes, 
prevent mistakes, and support teamwork in software development. 
These skills have strengthened my confidence in managing projects more efficiently and using professional tools that developers rely
on every day.
