What I Have Learned So Far in This Course
Throughout this course, I have learned the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, including how to create repositories, make commits, work with branches, and collaborate through pull requests. 
I now understand how version control helps track changes, prevent mistakes, and support teamwork in software development. These skills have strengthened my confidence in managing projects
more efficiently and using professional tools that developers rely on every day.

=== Reflections: Git & GitHub ===

Short (polished):
I completed a course on Git and GitHub covering core version-control concepts: repositories, branching, commits, and pull-request workflows. I can now create and manage repositories, use branches and commits effectively, and collaborate through pull requests to improve code quality and team coordination.

Longer (detailed):
- **Core concepts learned:** repositories, commits, branches, merges, and pull-request workflows.
- **Branching & merging:** practiced feature branches, switching branches, and resolving merge conflicts.
- **Collaboration:** created and reviewed pull requests, iterated on feedback, and improved code through discussion.
- **Commit practices:** made small, focused commits with clear messages to keep history understandable.
- **Next steps:** apply these skills in a real project, explore rebasing vs. merging, and add CI to PR workflows.

LinkedIn draft:
Excited to have completed a Git & GitHub course! I learned repositories, branching, commits, and collaborating via pull requests — skills that make teamwork and project management much smoother. Looking forward to applying these practices in real projects and diving into CI for automated PR checks.
